An intelligent energy platform company called Kaluza could possibly help the Orkney Islands solve this major inefficiency. Rolling out Kaluza’s system of smart heaters which control the heating of storage heaters as well as hot water cylinders could potentially allow households to use the energy that is currently being curtailed. Hence, investing in Kaluza’s smart heaters could be of financial interest for all parties involved; the consumers, the government, as well as the wind energy generators. If this were to be achieved, consumers would have access to cheaper energy, the local government could avoid the cost of expanding the 40MW cables to handle more energy, and the wind energy generators could expand their revenue stream.
