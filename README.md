An intelligent energy platform company called Kaluza could possibly help the Orkney Islands solve their major energy curtailement. Rolling out Kaluza’s system of smart heaters which control the heating of storage heaters as well as hot water cylinders could potentially allow households to use the energy that is currently being curtailed. Hence, investing in Kaluza’s smart heaters could be of financial interest for all parties involved; the consumers, the government, as well as the wind energy generators. If this were to be achieved, consumers would have access to cheaper energy, the local government could avoid the cost of expanding the 40MW cables to handle more energy, and the wind energy generators could expand their revenue stream.


To better evaluate the gains that all parties mentioned above could experience by reducing curtailment, it is necessary to first grasp the proportion of energy curtailment as well as the energy demand in Orkney Islands’ households. Hence, this report will focus on calculating the amount of wind energy curtailed that could be used to heat the households of Orkney using the Kaluza-controlled heaters.

Kaluza's smart heaters use AI and domestic flexibility which allow them to switch to using wind energy when their system indicates that the wind energy is being curtailed; when the wind-energy generation is over 40MW higher than the local demand as that is the cable’s capacity. Kaluza would make it possible for the wind energy generators to get extra revenue from the energy that would have been curtailed without Kaluza’s smart heaters. Therefore, Kaluza would in return generate their revenue by earning a share of the wind generator’s extra revenues.

The three main questions to be answered in this report:
- How much energy is currently curtailed annually across the Orkney Isles?
- How much can this be reduced by different levels of DR penetration?
- How many local households would need to be on our DR scheme in order to supply this level of DR? a financial analysis will be conducted to quantify the potential impacts that such an investment could have on savings by reducing the amount of energy from gas imported to the grid as well as on added revenue for the local wind energy generator.
